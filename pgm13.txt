How to Fix
1. File Extension
Make sure your file is named with a .jsp extension, for example:

text
localeDateForm.jsp
2. Run on a Java Web Server
Place your .jsp file inside the webapps directory of your Tomcat (or other Java EE server) project.

Start your server.

Access the file via http://localhost:8080/yourProjectName/localeDateForm.jsp

Do NOT open the file directly from your file system (file://...)
JSP must be processed by the server to convert the Java code into HTML.

3. Check Server Configuration
Ensure your server is running.

Make sure your browser URL starts with http://localhost:8080/... (or your configured port).

Summary
JSP code will only execute when run on a Java web server.

Directly opening the file in your browser will show the code as plain text.

If you do these steps and still see the code:
Double-check the file extension.

Make sure youâ€™re using the correct URL.

Ensure your server is running and properly deployed.
